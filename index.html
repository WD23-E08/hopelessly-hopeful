    <p>Some of the showcased procedures used to craft the mini website at hand include HTML structuring of the elements, and nesting them inside each other where appropriate per author's ideas, and linking outside photographies, published scientific and/or other articles from the internet, and further CSS styling the aforementioned HTML elements also in regards to the authors ideas and taste for aesthetics.</p>
